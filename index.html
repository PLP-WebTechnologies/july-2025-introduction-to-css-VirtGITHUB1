                <h2>Foundations in Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    Starting with HTML, I gained clarity on how structured markup forms the backbone of every 
                    modern web application. Each tag, attribute, and semantic element helped me build a stronger 
                    understanding of how information is presented in a clear and accessible way.

                <h2>Styling with Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    Transitioning into CSS revealed how design breathes life into structure. From typography to
                    spacing, margins, and paddings, I’ve learned how to style with intent—making content not only
                    functional, but also visually engaging and user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each styling decision now feels like a way of communicating with the user:  
                    font choices express clarity and professionalism, spacing creates balance, and
                    colors guide attention while enhancing readability.  
                    With CSS, I’ve gained the ability to turn plain layouts into meaningful experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond aesthetics, I’ve discovered how styling builds trust and usability.  
                    Whether it’s a simple button hover or a responsive card layout, CSS transforms a
                    static structure into something interactive and approachable—something that speaks
                    to the user before they even read the words.

                <h2>Mastering the Box Model</h2>
                <p>
                The Box Model has been a key milestone—showing how padding, borders, and margins influence 
                layout and responsiveness. Experimenting with these concepts gave me hands-on insight into 
                creating clean, scalable designs that reflect real-world development practices.
                </p>
                <!-- Box Model Illustration -->
                <div class="box-model-demo">
                    <div class="margin">
                        Margin
                        <div class="border">
                            Border
                            <div class="padding">
                                Padding
                                <div class="content">
                                    Content Area
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This layered structure taught me that design is about balance.  
                    Padding creates breathing space inside, borders provide structure, and margins ensure 
                    harmony between elements on a page. Together, they form the foundation of every 
                    professional layout I’ve worked on so far.
